"I calmed down a little on his palm and looked at the calligrapher's face. "
"The feeling of strangeness that I felt at that time still remains with me "

"スープの色は濃いめ、背脂も入っているのでかなり味が濃厚そうな印象ですラーメン"
"の具はメンマにチャーシュー、青々としたネギが大盛りのネギが乗っかっています。"
"ちょっと変わったところといえば、ニンニクチップがあるところで、味に同影響する"
"のか楽しみですね。モクモクと立ち上っていく湯気がすごい。味噌ベースの濃厚そう"
"なスープですが、そこまで味噌の香りが主張してこないのはにニンニクチップが入っ"
"ているからなのか？でも、ニンニクのニオイも控えめなので次の日に仕事でも大丈夫"

"The color of the soup is darker, and it also contains back fat, so it looks "
"quite rich in flavor. The ramen ingredients are menma (bamboo shoots), "
"chashu (pork chopsticks), and a large green onion on top. The only thing "
"that makes it a little different is the presence of garlic chips, and I'm "
"looking forward to seeing how they affect the taste. The steam rising up "
"from the bowl was amazing. It looks like a thick miso-based soup, but the "
"aroma of miso is not that overpowering, perhaps because of the garlic chips? "
"But the smell of garlic is also moderate, so you may be able to go to work "
"the next day. The steam that rises from the bowl will definitely warm you up."

"Pierre Hermé has many macarons that combine two flavors, and there were many "
"unusual combinations such as Vanilla & Saffron and Fresh Mint & Pea. The "
"flavors I chose at this time were chocolate, rose, and passion. The macaron "
"dough is light and the ganache (filling) has a distinct taste, so you can "
"feel the contrast. The rose-flavored macaroon, in particular, reminded me of "
"the yogurt in Ispahan, as the fragrance of roses spread out from the moment "
"you put it in your mouth, filling your mouth with roses. Pierre Hermé has "
"many macarons that combine two different flavors, and there were many "
"unusual combinations such as vanilla and saffron or fresh mint and pea.  "

"The meat has a nice crunchy texture. When you bite into it, the juices "
"overflow and the flavor is amazing. The meat that swam in the pool of flavor "
"disappeared quickly down my throat. I would like to give it a gold medal. I "
"just sprinkled rock salt and pepper on the meat, and grilled it slowly. The "
"golden fat dripped down like sweat and burst into flames, creating an "
"irresistible aroma. The beef used is Wagyu beef produced in Iwate "
"Prefecture. The more you bite into it, the more the unique flavor of wagyu "
"increases, and the more satisfied you will feel."
